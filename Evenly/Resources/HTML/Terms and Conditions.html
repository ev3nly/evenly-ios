<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Payments, Charges and Withdrawals</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Default Payment Sources<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p4">When you make a payment on Evenly, we first see if your Evenly balance can cover the transaction. You can also fund payments with a debit card or credit card. The most recent debit or credit card added to your account will be automatically designated as your primary funding source. If there is not enough available in your Evenly balance to cover the transaction we use your designated primary funding source to make the payment.</p>
<p class="p4">We always use your Evenly balance first. If you don’t want to use your balance, you can withdraw it before making a payment.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Refused or Refunded Transactions</b></p>
<p class="p4">When you send money, the recipient is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold Evenly liable for any damages resulting from a recipient’s decision not to accept a payment made through the service. We will return any unclaimed, refunded or denied payment within 30 Days of the date you initiate payment. If a payment is unclaimed, denied or refunded for any reason, we will return the money to your Balance or to the original payment source.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Payment Investigation</b></p>
<p class="p4">Payment investigation is a process by which Evenly reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. If a payment is subject to payment investigation, Evenly will place a hold on the payment and provide notice to the seller to delay item fulfilment (if applicable). Evenly will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the payment. If the payment is cleared, Evenly will provide notice to the seller. Otherwise, Evenly will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer. Evenly will provide notices to you by email and/or in the Transaction History tab of your Evenly account.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Risk of Reversals, Chargebacks and Claims</b></p>
<p class="p4">When you receive a payment, you are liable to Evenly for the full amount of the payment plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment, plus the applicable fees if you lose a claim or a chargeback, or if there is a reversal of the payment. You agree to allow Evenly to recover any amounts due to Evenly by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Evenly through other means. If a sender of a payment files a chargeback, the credit card issuer, not Evenly, will determine who wins the chargeback.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Taxes</b></p>
<p class="p4">It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Evenly is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Your Refund Policy and Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p class="p4">We recommend that when selling goods or services you have a published return policy and a published privacy policy on your website.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Transaction History. You may view your transaction history by logging into your Evenly account and looking at your account history. You agree to review your transactions through your account history instead of receiving periodic statements by mail.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Assignment of Interest to Evenly</b></p>
<p class="p4">You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that Evenly handles as your agent and places in pooled accounts. In consideration for your use of the service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Evenly any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this agreement grants Evenly any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain with Evenly. In addition to or instead of earning interest on pooled accounts, Evenly may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged for banking services by the banks that hold your funds.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Withdrawal Limits</p>
<p class="p4">Depending on the degree to which you have verified your account, we may limit your monthly withdrawals. In addition, we may delay withdrawals of large sums of money while we screen for risk.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fees</b></p>
<p class="p4">At this moment, Evenly is completely free to use. However, we reserve the right to implement fees at any time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Limitations</b></p>
<p class="p4">Evenly provides you with the opportunity to make payments for goods &amp; services. You may pay for any activity in any amount you choose. This excludes campaigns where you are the Content Creator. You may make as many purchases as you’d like. However, we may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of purchases you make can with our service.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

You acknowledge and agree that all your payments are between you, Evenly Users, and the Processor only, and that Evenly is not responsible for transactions, including without limitation any personal or payment information you provide to the Processor (Balanced Payments or other processors hired by Evenly).</p>
<p class="p4">Evenly makes no promises, verifications, or guarantees regarding the deductibility of any Contribution for tax purposes. Evenly does not and will not offer or provide tax advice. Please consult your tax advisor for more information.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Processor</b></p>
